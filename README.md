Hey! I’m Fernando Guisso, an Application Security Engineer at WillBank. Born and raised in Brazil, I’m all about creating secure, efficient, and downright clever solutions. My tech stack includes Go, JavaScript, and Vue.js, and I’m all over the place with security tools like SAST, DAST, and Threat Modeling. Basically, if it’s about making software safer and smoother, I’m in.

## About Me

- 🔐 **Security Engineer**: Obsessed with simplifying and automating security practices, I help teams build security directly into their pipelines without all the hassle.
- 💡 **Open-Source & Community Fan**: I’m big on open-source! I love collaborating, sharing knowledge, and making things that help others work more securely. You might catch me at [OWASP](https://owasp.org) Chapters & Events or [SunsecRN](https://sunsecrn.github.io) meetups.
- ⚙️ **GitHub Automation Enthusiast**: I love using Github tools to make life easier, automating everything from my [Github Pages blog](https://github.com/fguisso/fguisso.github.io), this [README updates](https://github.com/fguisso/fguisso/blob/master/.github/workflows/posts.yml) and deploying presentation [slides on Github Pages](https://github.com/fguisso/talks). Sometimes, just for *studies porpouse*, [security tooling](https://github.com/fguisso/ga-recon) using Github Actions.


## Fun Facts

- 📈 **Spreadsheet Wiz** (Reluctantly): Believe it or not, I’m great with Excel and Google Sheets, even though I can’t stand using them.
- 🎸 **One-Man Band** *in Progress*: I’m learning drums, guitar, bass, and singing to put together a one-man band – because why not? Check the progress [here](https://guisso.dev/music).
- 🌊 **Open-Water Adventurer**: I’m into open-sea swimming and running, working toward my goal of becoming a Aquathlon athlete.
